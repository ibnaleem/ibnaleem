## üêç Python Developer
I am a proficient Python programmer who began coding at the age of 13. My most recent projects include [SnapscoreTracker](https://github.com/ibnaleem/snapscoretracker) and [InstaTracker](https://github.com/ibnaleem/instatracker). My interest in blockchain technology prompted me to implement a simple [blockchain in Python.](https://github.com/ibnaleem/blockchain) I learned Haskell and Java during my time at university and am currently expanding my skill set by learning C, C++, and C#/.NET.
